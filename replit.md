## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend utilizes React 18 with TypeScript and Vite. Radix UI provides accessible components, styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent and branded look using the Great Vibes font. The design emphasizes a clear, multi-role dashboard experience for Admin, Manager, and Employee users.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query, Wouter.
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, bcrypt, session-based authentication.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon Database, Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations and migrations. Sessions are PostgreSQL-backed with a 7-day expiration.
- **Data Storage**: Local file system for handling document uploads.
- **Communication**: Mobile-first SMS-integrated system with Twilio API, SendGrid for email notifications, WebSocket support, smart notification routing.
- **Authentication**: Session-based, role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Employee), with employee invitation and password reset.

### Feature Specifications
- **Time Management**: Clock in/out with break tracking, multi-location work scheduling, and time off request management.
- **Communication & Support**: **[PRODUCTION READY]** Mobile-first SMS-integrated team messaging with complete interactive response system. Features include:
  - **SMS Quick Reactions**: Emoji/keyword detection (‚úÖüëç‚ùå‚ùì + "yes", "ok", "help", etc.) with 3-word smart classification
  - **Response Threading**: SMS responses automatically link to announcements with professional confirmation messages
  - **Dual Response System**: Separate storage for announcement reactions and text responses with proper UI display

### System Design Choices
The system follows a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend. Authentication is session-based with robust password hashing. Data flow is designed for clarity, and performance is considered through optimized database queries and consistent timezone handling (CST). The architecture supports multi-merchant configurations for integrations like Clover POS.

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Real-time API data fetching for accurate business metrics
- WebSocket connections for instant messaging updates
- Efficient React Query caching with proper cache invalidation
- "Last 24 Hours" filtering for meaningful dashboard data
- Scheduled message processing with 30-second intervals

**Current System Status:**
- **SMS Response System**: Fully operational with emoji reactions, text responses, and UI display
- **Database Schema**: Complete with `announcement_reactions` table and proper relationships
- **API Coverage**: All endpoints implemented for announcement/message reactions and responses

**Known Issues to Address:**
- 65 LSP diagnostics requiring cleanup for production deployment
- WebSocket disconnection handling needs optimization
- Type safety improvements needed across server routes

**SMS Testing Commands (for tomorrow):**
- Quick reactions: `üëç`, `yes`, `‚úÖ`, `ok`, `good` ‚Üí Creates reactions
- Text responses: `This looks great, thanks for the update!` ‚Üí Creates threaded responses
- Mixed support: System automatically detects reaction vs response intent
