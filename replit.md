## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend utilizes React 18 with TypeScript and Vite. Radix UI provides accessible components, styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent and branded look using the Great Vibes font. The design emphasizes a clear, multi-role dashboard experience for Admin, Manager, and Employee users with dedicated page access for department-specific operations.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query, Wouter.
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, bcrypt, session-based authentication.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon Database, Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations and migrations. Sessions are PostgreSQL-backed with a 7-day expiration.
- **Data Storage**: Local file system for handling document uploads.
- **Communication**: Mobile-first SMS-integrated system with Twilio API, SendGrid for email notifications, WebSocket support, smart notification routing.
- **Authentication**: Session-based, role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Employee), with employee invitation and password reset.

### System Design Choices
The system follows a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend. Authentication is session-based with robust password hashing. Data flow is designed for clarity, and performance is considered through optimized database queries and consistent timezone handling (CST). The architecture supports multi-merchant configurations for integrations like Clover POS and department-specific page access for enhanced security and user experience.
