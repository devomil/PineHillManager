- **AI Video Production System**: Marketing page feature for creating promotional videos, including a "Video Generation Priority Chain" (fal.ai, Runway Gen-4, Hugging Face, Stock B-roll) and "Image Generation Priority Chain" (fal.ai FLUX models, Stability AI, Hugging Face, Stock images). Features AI Visual Directions (Claude analysis, multiple alternatives, scene breakdown, user selection, constraint enforcement, approval workflow) and a Brand Assets Library for logo/watermark management. Includes a Quality Evaluation System with anatomical accuracy and defect detection, triggering auto-regeneration. Utilizes Remotion Lambda for server-side video rendering with multiple output formats (16:9, 9:16, 1:1). **Async Video Generation Jobs**: Video generation uses a persistent job queue system (`video_generation_jobs` table) with background worker processing to avoid 502 timeouts. Jobs are created immediately and processed asynchronously with progress tracking, retry logic (max 3 attempts), stuck job recovery (10-minute threshold), and frontend polling for status updates. The worker runs every 3 seconds checking for pending jobs. **Brand Asset Service Integration**: The `BrandAssetService` provides smart resolution of brand assets from the `brand_media_library` database table before AI generation, using semantic matching for visual directions. Features include: logo overlay support (`logoUrl`, `logoPosition` in SceneAssets), B-roll content filtering via `isBrollContentAppropriate()` to prevent inappropriate matches (e.g., nurse smoking for wellness videos), and keyword-based asset matching for Pine Hill Farm branding, wellness centers, and store locations. **Phase 14A: Brand Requirement Analyzer**: The `brand-requirement-analyzer.ts` service parses visual directions to detect brand asset requirements (products, logos, branding). Uses pattern matching for product names, branding keywords, and visibility modifiers. Determines scene types: `product-hero`, `product-in-context`, `branded-environment`, or `standard`. API: `POST /api/universal-video/brand-analysis/analyze`. **Phase 14B: Brand Asset Matcher**: The `brand-asset-matcher.ts` service matches detected requirements against the Brand Media library. Queries `brandMediaLibrary` table for products, logos, and locations based on detected requirements. Scores matches by keyword relevance, priority, and asset type. API endpoints: `POST /api/universal-video/brand-assets/match`, `POST /api/universal-video/brand-assets/best`, `POST /api/universal-video/brand-assets/search`. Integration: Both services are integrated into `universal-video-service.ts` during asset preparation, storing `brandAnalysis` on scenes for later use. **Product Image Generation**: Uses Flux.1 via PiAPI (~$0.03/image) to generate professional product images with 4 types (product-shot, lifestyle, hero, overlay) and 4 styles (studio, natural, artistic, minimal). Automatically integrated during asset generation for products without uploaded images, with fallback chain in Remotion (productOverlayImage → generatedProductImage → productOverlayUrl → productImage). **Scene Analysis**: Uses Claude Vision (~$0.02/scene) to analyze video frames and images for optimal composition. Detects faces and positions, identifies safe zones for text/overlays, and provides recommendations for text color, shadows, and product placement. Analysis is stored in `scene.analysis` field and used by the Remotion composition for intelligent text positioning. Supports video frame extraction via FFmpeg for video analysis. Falls back to sensible defaults when Anthropic API is unavailable. **Intelligent Text Placement**: The `composition-instructions-service.ts` translates scene analysis into precise positioning instructions for text and product overlays. Features include: AI-powered text positioning that avoids faces and respects safe zones, dynamic color/shadow based on background brightness, animation selection based on mood (dramatic = zoom, neutral = fade), and product overlay scaling based on face presence. The Remotion composition uses `IntelligentTextOverlay` and `IntelligentProductOverlay` components that consume these instructions with fallback to traditional lower-third or centered text when no analysis is available. Composition instructions are stored in `scene.compositionInstructions` and include TextOverlayInstruction (position x/y/anchor, style, animation) and ProductOverlayInstruction (enabled, position, scale, animation, shadow). **Smart Text Overlay Restoration (Phase 10E)**: The `text-overlay-detector.ts` service automatically detects scenes requiring text overlays based on: CTA scene type detection, numbered list patterns (1. item 2. item), "try this:" / "steps:" / "tips:" keywords, and visual direction patterns ("text overlay", "show text"). The `text-overlay-generator.ts` generates Remotion-compatible overlays with staggered bullet list animations (slide-up with 0.5s delays), CTA styling (centered, bold, with pop animation), proper timing and positioning. Integration occurs during `prepareAssetsForLambda()` where each scene is analyzed and text overlays are automatically injected before rendering. **Brand Context Service (Phase 6A)**: Centralized brand knowledge store at `server/brand-context/pine-hill-farm.json` containing 14 services, 6 product categories, terminology guidelines, visual identity (colors, aesthetic), and content guidelines. The `brandContextService` provides context formatters for AI injection: `getScriptParsingContext()`, `getVisualAnalysisContext()`, `getQualityEvaluationContext()`, `getPromptEnhancementContext()`, and `matchScriptToServices()`. Uses 1-hour TTL caching. API endpoints: `/api/brand-context`, `/api/brand-context/match`, `/api/brand-context/script-parsing`, `/api/brand-context/visual-analysis`, `/api/brand-context/quality-evaluation`, `/api/brand-context/prompt-enhancement`. **Script Parsing Context (Phase 6B)**: Brand-aware script parsing service at `server/services/script-parser-service.ts` that injects Pine Hill Farm brand context into Claude Sonnet 4 for intelligent script analysis. Features: brand-aware system prompt with PHF services, products, terminology, and visual aesthetic; enhanced Scene interface with 5 brand-specific fields (serviceMatch, productMatch, conditionMatch, audienceResonance, brandOpportunity); automatic service/product/condition matching using brandContextService; scene type classification (hook, problem, agitation, solution, benefit, proof, product, testimonial, cta, etc.); and visual direction generation matching PHF's warm, natural aesthetic. API endpoint: `POST /api/universal-video/parse-script` returns scenes array with brand matches, summary with primaryService and targetConditions, and brandMatches object.

### System Design Choices
The system maintains a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend. Authentication is session-based with robust password hashing. Data flow is optimized for clarity and performance through efficient database queries and consistent timezone handling. The architecture supports multi-merchant configurations and department-specific page access. Key optimizations include real-time API data fetching, React Query caching, and self-contained component design. All endpoints require proper authentication. Database migration follows a safe, incremental workflow. Automated inventory synchronization runs every 15 minutes using the Clover POS bulk `/item_stocks` endpoint for efficiency.
