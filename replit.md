## System Architecture

### UI/UX Decisions
The frontend utilizes React 18 with TypeScript and Vite. Radix UI provides accessible components, styled with Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent and branded look using the Great Vibes font. The design emphasizes a clear, multi-role dashboard experience for Admin, Manager, and Employee users with dedicated page access for department-specific operations.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, Radix UI, Tailwind CSS, TanStack Query, Wouter.
- **Backend**: Express.js, TypeScript, PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, bcrypt, session-based authentication.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on Neon Database, Drizzle ORM for type-safe operations and migrations.
- **Data Storage**: Local file system for handling document uploads.
- **Communication**: Mobile-first SMS-integrated system with Twilio API, SendGrid for email notifications, WebSocket support, smart notification routing.
- **Authentication**: Session-based, role-based access control (Admin, Manager, Employee), with employee invitation and password reset.

### Feature Specifications
- **Time Management**: Clock in/out with break tracking, multi-location work scheduling, and time off request management.
- **Communication & Support**: Mobile-first SMS-integrated team messaging with interactive response, TCPA-compliant consent tracking, and real-time integration via WebSockets. SMS notifications include 2-3 sentence message previews and clickable links to https://PHFManager.co for viewing full messages.
- **Document Management**: Role-based file sharing.
- **Inventory Management**: Dedicated `/inventory` page with comprehensive dual-system tracking reconciling Clover POS (live inventory) and Thrive (vendor/cost data). Features include:
  - **Dual-System Dashboard**: Unified view showing sync status overview (synced items, discrepancies, unmatched items, missing vendor data) and profitability summary (average margin %, total inventory value, potential gross profit, top profitable items by margin).
  - **Sync Status Tab**: Real-time reconciliation tracking with visual indicators (✅ synced, ⚠️ discrepancy, ℹ️ unmatched). Displays matched items (Thrive ↔ Clover), unmatched Thrive items requiring manual matching, and Clover items missing vendor data. Filter by sync status (all/synced/discrepancy). 
  - **Profitability Analytics**: Item-level profitability analysis with margin %, markup %, unit profit, and gross profit calculations. Vendor-level analytics enhanced with average margin and markup percentages per vendor and location. Endpoints: `/api/accounting/inventory/profitability` (item-level), `/api/accounting/inventory/vendors` (vendor-level with profitability). **Dual Pricing System** (Oct 14, 2025): Clover POS pricing and Thrive vendor pricing now stored separately in dedicated database fields (`unitCost`/`unitPrice` for Clover, `thriveCost`/`thriveListPrice` for Thrive). CSV imports and manual matches preserve Clover pricing while storing Thrive data in separate columns. Profitability Summary UI displays side-by-side comparison with blue cards showing Clover POS metrics (current sale prices/margins) and purple cards showing Thrive vendor metrics (cost/list data). API returns both pricing systems with independent margin calculations for comparison analysis.
  - **Manual Matching Interface** (Admin-only): Comprehensive UI for linking unmatched Thrive items to Clover items. Features include: (1) "Match" button on unmatched items in Sync Status tab (visible only to admins), (2) Smart match suggestions dialog with multi-factor scoring algorithm (SKU exact match: 100, name exact: 80, partial name: 50, word overlap: 10/word, category: 20), (3) Visual score badges (green 80%+, yellow 50-79%, gray <50%), (4) Detailed item comparison showing SKU, stock quantity/units, location, category, and vendor data, (5) One-click match confirmation with automatic cache invalidation. Multi-location search: Algorithm searches ALL 5 Clover locations (Lake Geneva Retail, Watertown Retail, Pinehillfarm.co Online, Lake Geneva HSA, Watertown HSA) simultaneously via `getAllInventoryItems()` without location filter to find best matches regardless of which store has the item. Backend APIs: POST `/api/accounting/inventory/manual-match` to save matches, GET `/api/accounting/inventory/match-suggestions/:thriveItemId` to fetch scored suggestions with flattened response structure (id, name, sku, locationName, quantityOnHand, score, matchReason). Storage interface methods: `getUnmatchedThriveItems()` (with conditional and() fix for Drizzle), `getUnmatchedThriveItemById()`, `createUnmatchedThriveItem()`, `updateUnmatchedThriveItem()`. Critical fix (Oct 10, 2025): Corrected database query to use `storage.getUnmatchedThriveItemById()` instead of invalid `storage.db.select()`, preventing "Cannot read properties of undefined" error. Last implemented: October 10, 2025.
  - **Discrepancy Resolution** (Admin-only): Full workflow for investigating and resolving quantity discrepancies between Clover and Thrive systems. Discrepancy items display side-by-side comparison showing Clover quantity, Thrive quantity, and the difference. "Update Count" button opens physical count dialog where admins can: (1) View current discrepancy details with color-coded quantities (blue=Clover, purple=Thrive, orange=difference), (2) Enter new physical count from actual inventory, (3) Add optional notes for audit trail, (4) One-click update to Clover via API that automatically updates local database and recalculates sync status. System automatically resolves discrepancy flag if new count matches Thrive quantity (within 0.001 tolerance). Backend API: POST `/api/accounting/inventory/update-physical-count` uses CloverIntegration to update stock in Clover and syncs local database. Workflow validates admin role and location configuration before allowing updates. Last implemented: October 10, 2025.
  - **CSV Import Enhancement**: Thrive CSV import now tracks sync status with fields: importSource, syncStatus, matchMethod, thriveQuantity, hasDiscrepancy, lastThriveImport. Unmatched items saved to unmatchedThriveItems table for reconciliation. Match methods: SKU+Location+Name, SKU+Location, Name+Location, SKU, Product+Location. Discrepancy detection when |Clover qty - Thrive qty| > 0.001.
  - **Core Stats**: Fully synced with Clover POS (5,981 items across 5 locations). Location tracking via `locationId` mapping. Out of 5,981 items, 143 have active stock (2.4%). Last import: October 10, 2025 (2,604 matched, 401 unmatched from 3,735 CSV rows).
- **Order Management**: Dedicated `/orders` page for comprehensive order processing with real-time analytics, payment tracking, and performance insights across all store locations. Critical performance optimization implemented: early date/location filtering before expensive financial calculations, reducing load times from 136+ seconds to 2-4 seconds (meeting 3-second SLA).
- **Accounting**: Comprehensive financial management with live integrations for Clover POS, Amazon Store, HSA, and Thrive inventory. Features real-time revenue dashboards, multi-location analytics, and fully operational COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) calculations with real-time cost tracking and gross profit analysis.
  - **🚨 CRITICAL: Discount Reporting (100% Accuracy Required)**: Discount calculation logic achieves exact match with Clover reports across all locations and date ranges. Implementation uses Clover's discount objects (both order-level and line-item level), calculates percentage discounts from pre-discount subtotal, and rounds each discount individually before summing. This logic is protected and requires authorization, regression testing, and validation before any modifications. Reports $0 for orders with no discount objects even if reconciliation shows difference (line items created at discounted price). Last validated: September 30, 2025. Location: `server/storage.ts` - `calculateOrderFinancialMetrics` method (lines 5567-5677).
  - **🚨 CRITICAL: Refund Tracking (Exact Match Required)**: Credit refund tracking matches Clover reports exactly across all date ranges. Clover's credit_refunds API endpoint has a critical limitation: it completely ignores createdTime.min/max parameters and returns ALL refunds regardless of date range. Implementation adds server-side date filtering (lines 7140-7156 in `server/routes.ts`) by checking each refund's createdTime against requested date range after fetching. Week definitions use Sunday-Saturday to align with Clover's reporting periods. Last validated: October 1, 2025. Verified: "Last Week" (Sept 21-27) shows 2 refunds totaling $262.96 matching Clover exactly.
  - **Amazon Product Fees & COGS**: Amazon order financials are calculated by fetching order items (SKU/ASIN) for each order during list transformation (`server/routes.ts` lines 6882-6944). System always requests FBA fees (`isAmazonFulfilled: true`) to provide consistent fee estimates across all products, even for MFN orders. Fee calculation hierarchy: SKU first → ASIN fallback if SKU returns $0. COGS matching uses hierarchy: SKU → ASIN → fuzzy name matching (Levenshtein ≤3) → 60% estimation fallback. Line items structure is built during transformation to enable COGS calculation. Amazon fees and COGS display correctly in Financial Analysis cards. Last implemented: October 2, 2025.
- **Video Generation**: A professional video engine built with native Canvas API for creating animated explainer videos, integrating multiple APIs for content generation, voiceover synthesis, and imagery.
- **Employee Purchase Portal**: Dedicated `/employee-purchases` page for employees to scan and purchase inventory items using their monthly employee purchase allowance. Features barcode/SKU/ASIN scanner input (compatible with USB barcode scanners), shopping cart with quantity management, real-time balance tracking, monthly allowance enforcement, and purchase history. Automatically displayed on employee dashboard when `employeePurchaseEnabled` benefit is activated. Last implemented: October 6, 2025.

### System Design Choices
The system follows a clear separation of concerns between frontend and backend. Authentication is session-based with robust password hashing. Data flow is designed for clarity, and performance is considered through optimized database queries and consistent timezone handling (CST). The architecture supports multi-merchant configurations and department-specific page access. Key optimizations include real-time API data fetching, efficient React Query caching, and a self-contained component design where components auto-fetch data. All endpoints require proper authentication.
