    <h1>Black Cohosh Extract Plus</h1>
    <div class="description">
      Black Cohosh is an herb that provides a natural way to normalize hormonal changes and moderate the uncomfortable changes that accompany menopause. Numerous studies have been done using black cohosh. Studies have identified the isoflavone phytoestrogen formononetin as the most likely candidate for the effects of black cohosh on female health. This compound has been shown to help support normal, healthy levels of luteinizing hormone (LH).† Increased LH levels, which are often the result of declining estrogen levels, are typically responsible for the changes associated with menopause. Dong quai and chasteberry are included for their synergistic effects, which helps support a normal, healthy response to female hormone imbalance and support symptoms associated with menopause.
