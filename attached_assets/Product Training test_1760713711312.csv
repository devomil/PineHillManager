Product,431,Chewable L-Theanine,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">200mg of the clinically-proven AlphaWave&reg; brand L-Theanine in a natural lemonade flavored chewable tablet. L-Theanine is an amino acid found in green tea leaves, and is one of nature&rsquo;s most effective natural relaxants. Substantive clinical research demonstrates L-Theanine&rsquo;s primary method of action: it increases dopamine and serotonin production in the brain and induces relaxation through the enhancement of alpha wave activity in the brain, permitting a natural calm. AlphaWave&reg; L-Theanine is produced through a proprietary fermentation process that results in a highly purified form of the amino acid. Today, the reason for AlphaWave&reg;&rsquo;s L-Theanine growing consumer demand is that when people take it, they feel a difference. AlphaWave&reg; L-Theanine directly stimulates the production of alpha brain waves, creating a state of deep relaxation and focused energy.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">AlphaWave&reg; may support healthy relaxation without drowsiness, healthy mental clarity and focus, enhance learning and memory, reduce nervous tension, and reduce the psychological and physiological responses to stress.</span></p>",/chewable-l-theanine/,,,

Product,521,Vitamin D3/K2,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A highly bioavailable form of Vitamin D combined with vegetarian friendly Vitamin K2. Vitamins D3 and K2 are both fat-soluble vitamins with similar structures that provide many various benefits to the body. However, when combined, these forms of the two vitamins focus mainly on helping to improve both bone health and cardiovascular health. The synergistic relationship helps to properly utilize calcium within the body, from the absorption to the binding of calcium to bones. Vitamin D3 plays a main role in regulating calcium metabolism by increasing intestinal calcium absorption. Vitamin K2 is essential for binding newly absorbed calcium to the mineral matrix in bone. Studies have shown that vitamin K2 is the more bioavailable form of the nutrient and influences bone building more powerfully than K1. The mechanism of action of Vitamins D3 and K2 not only enhances bone strength and structure but also helps to improve cardiovascular health by removing excess calcium from the bloodstream, limiting the chance of arteriosclerosis. Helps maintain adequate blood calcium levels which help support cellular metabolic processes, cardiovascular and neuromuscular/neurological function. Vitamins D3 and K2 are associated with stronger immune function and help to balance the inflammatory response.</span></p>",/vitamin-d3-k2/,,,

DHA is important for the structure and function of cell membranes, particularly those of the nervous system. DHA is critical for normal, healthy brain structure and function. EPA is found in small amounts in the brain, but is required for numerous regulatory functions throughout the body. EPA helps support a healthy inflammatory response and optimal cardiovascular function.

Product,523,Liver Support & Detox,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A synergistic combination of B-vitamins, minerals, botanicals, and other nutraceuticals such as SelenoExcell&reg; and NAC. The liver is a complex organ with a variety of functions. It plays a major role in the detoxification of endotoxins (metabolically produced) and xenobiotics (environmental). Detoxification is a process that involves several different organs and occurs primarily in the liver. The liver achieves this through two distinct phases whereby it prepares the toxins for excretion. Some toxins are excreted through the bile, and others through the kidneys. In phase 1, toxins are transformed into intermediate compounds which are then neutralized by phase 2 enzymes making them easier for the body to excrete. Our product contains milt thistle and other standardized extracts such as turmeric, artichoke, and picrorhiz to help support the liver and liver functions.</span></p>",/liver-support-detox/,,,

Product,524,Ultra GI Cleanse,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">A synergistic combination of ingredients to target the underlying causes of common gastrointestinal problems and encourage regularity. Gastrointestinal problems are common conditions that plague our society. Pharmacies and supermarkets offer a wide selection of products designed to provide temporary relief of symptoms, rather than address the underlying cause. The majority of gastrointestinal conditions are related to the typical American diet which focuses on highly processed and refined, high fat, high sugar, and low fiber foods. This type of diet results in poor digestive health which can lead to irregular bowel movements and the increased amount of time fecal matter comes in contact with the cells lining the intestinal tract. Our Ultra GI Cleanse formula provides a synergistic combination of ingredients that help support normal, healthy bowel function, which in turn encourages the &ldquo;regular&rdquo; elimination of waste material. By encouraging &ldquo;regularity&rdquo;, this formula helps support overall health and wellness, which is oftentimes related to normal, healthy gastrointestinal function. </span></p>",/ultra-gi-cleanse/,,,

Product,526,Ubiquinol,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">200mg of CoQ10 in the reduced, stabilized ubiquinol form, delivered in an easy to swallow soft gel capsule. CoQ10 plays a major role in the production of energy (ATP) and as an antioxidant to help protect the cell. CoQ10 gets converted from the ubiquinone form to the ubiquinol form, and functions as an antioxidant. Age, certain prescription medicines and health deficiencies reduce the body&rsquo;s ability to manufacture ubiquinol from the ubiquinone form. Sub-optimal levels may reduce energy production and weaken the body&rsquo;s immune and antioxidant defenses. Supplementation with CoQ10 in the reduced, more active Ubiquinol form supports the body&rsquo;s antioxidant requirements to help combat free radicals, while helping it to maintain healthy ATP (energy) levels.&nbsp;</span></p>

Product,529,Red Yeast Rice,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Provides 600mg of red yeast rice per serving in these easy to swallow vegetarian capsules. Carefully manufactured to avoid the presence of citrinin (a toxic by-product of the fermentation process). Cardiovascular disease continues to be the leading cause of mortality in the United States. One of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease is elevated total and LDL (&ldquo;bad&rdquo;) cholesterol. There are several categories of prescription drugs that are designed to help lower cholesterol; the most commonly prescribed being Statin drugs. Statins are effective at lowering total and LDL cholesterol, but they are associated with significant side effects. Many individuals with elevated cholesterol have been able to improve their cardiovascular health through diet, exercise, and nutraceutical supplements. One of the nutraceuticals that have been shown in research studies to support normal LDL and total cholesterol levels is red yeast rice. Red yeast rice is the product of yeast (Monascus purpureus) grown on rice, and is served as a dietary staple in some Asian countries. It contains several compounds that are collectively known as monacolins which support the mechanisms that can lead to improved cardiovascular health.</span></p>",/red-yeast-rice/,,,

Several nutrients are involved in the production of these neurotransmitters. We created our Mood Support formula to help address the &ldquo;deficiencies&rdquo; that might contribute to difficulty in stabilizing a person&rsquo;s mood. There are several herbs and other nutraceuticals that may help support a &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; mood. St. John&rsquo;s Wort is widely regarded for its mood supporting benefits.</span> <span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Siberian Eleutherococcus is an effective adaptogen, which has been shown to support healthy stress response and a natural &ldquo;boost&rdquo; in energy levels. Numerous scientific studies show 5- HTP is of benefit in individuals with mood disorders. 5-HTP has many advantages over L-tryptophan. Besides being safer to produce and arguably more potent, it can cross the very selective blood-brain barrier more easily than L-tryptophan. Once it passes through the blood-brain barrier it is able to help increase levels of serotonin; a neurotransmitter, whose levels are positively associated with mood.</span></p>",/mood-support/,,,

Product,538,Methylfolate Lozenges,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Methylfolate (5-MTHF) is the coenzyme form of folate and is the most biologically active type of folate found in the human body. Unlike folic acid, it needs no enzymatic conversion and is therefore six times more bioavailable. Also, as many as 50% of people suffer from a genetic disorder that prevents them from adequately converting folate into 5-MTHF. Supplemental 5- MTHF quickly increases both blood and cellular levels. This high potency formula comes in a conveniently dosed lozenge that dissolves under the tongue. The lozenge ensures that methylfolate travels very quickly into the bloodstream.&nbsp;</span></p>

Substantive clinical research demonstrates L-Theanine&rsquo;s primary method of action: it increases dopamine and serotonin production in the brain and induces relaxation through the enhancement of alpha wave activity in the brain, permitting a natural calm. AlphaWave&reg; L-Theanine is produced through a proprietary fermentation process that results in a highly purified form of the amino acid.&nbsp;</span></p>

Product,545,Colloidal Silver,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The Ancient Greeks, Egyptians, and Romans used silver to support immune function. These ancient cultures learned that silver possessed powerful anti-microbial effects. Phoenicians stored water, wine, and vinegar in silver bottles to prevent spoiling. Hippocrates, the &ldquo;father of medicine&rdquo;, wrote that silver had beneficial healing and anti-disease properties, and he praised silver for its tissue repair and wound healing abilities. In the Middle Ages, silver spoons were given by wealthy godparents to babies as baptismal presents, believing that those &ldquo;born with a silver spoon in their mouths&rdquo; survived illness and the plague due to silver&rsquo;s cleansing properties. Silver was one of the few antimicrobial treatments available before the discovery of antibiotic drugs. By the 1930s, Colloidal silver was the preferred choice of physicians for empowering the immune system and supporting the body&rsquo;s innate healing process. In the mid-1960s, NASA developed a lightweight generator to dispense silver ions into the drinking water aboard Apollo spacecraft to kill bacteria, and in 2015, they approved the use of a silver-based water purification system aboard the International Space Station. Today, silver is experiencing a renaissance as consumers seek out more natural ways to support their health and well-being.

Product,552,Adrenal Support,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The adrenal glands produce hormones that support the biochemical and physiological mechanisms for dealing with mental and physical stress, and also secrete chemicals involved in nutrient metabolism and energy production. Chronic anxiety, nervous tension and other types of stress may lead to excess production of cortisol, a hormone involved in stress response. Excess intake of stimulants such as caffeine and sugar can exacerbate stress and lead to adrenal &ldquo;fatigue&rdquo;. The constant stimulation of the adrenal glands may eventually result in an abnormal stress response, low energy and poor immune function. </span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Our Adrenal Support formula is a synergistic combination of nutraceuticals designed to support healthy adrenal function. Contains ashwagandha root extract, a Russian source of Rhodiola rosea, vitamin B6, pantothenic acid, vitamin C, licorice root, astragalus, and schizandra to help support adrenal functions and helping the body better deal with the effects of stress. Eleuthero is known for its adaptogenic benefits, including managing fatigue and supporting healthy corticosteroid levels in response to mental and or physical stress.</span></p>",/adrenal-support/,,,

Small amounts of creatine can be manufactured by the body, mainly in the liver and kidneys. This creatine is then transported through the blood to skeletal muscle, which requires it for peak performance. Unfortunately, the amount of creatine shown in clinical research studies to help support and improve exercise performance, muscle protein synthesis, and related functions is much greater than what the body can produce and what we consume in our diets.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is where supplemental creatine as creatine monohydrate comes in. Several grams of supplemental creatine monohydrate can provide significant support to working muscles and has been shown to increase performance, strength, and muscle mass. Most of the research on creatine has used high quality, pharmaceutical grade creatine monohydrate. Our creatine monohydrate is manufactured by a recognized world leader in creatine research, development, and manufacturing. We offer this brand of creatine as it is the one most commonly used in research studies and has been proven effective in athletes and also in those individuals who are just looking for that &ldquo;edge&rdquo; that will help them achieve their fitness and athletic goals. Our creatine is consistently tested and shown to be free of creatinine, dicyandiamide, and dihydrotriazine, impurities typically found in poor quality creatine products. </span></p>",/creatine-monohydrate-powder/,,,

Product,585,Collagen Peptides Creamer,"<p><span style=""font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"">Collagen is the most abundant protein in the body, and is the main component of connective tissue. It is the tough, fibrous protein in hair, nails, tendons, ligaments, and skin. Collagen helps preserve the elastin in skin, helping it to stay toned and supple, and collagen also gives tendons and ligaments their toughness. As we age, our body begins producing less collagen, which is one reason why skin starts to sag and joints become achy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"">Our Collagen Peptides Powder is hydrolyzed and contains types 1 &amp; 3 collagen which supports skin, muscles and bone health. Hydrolyzed collagen is easier to absorb, allowing the amino acids to be utilized more efficiently. It supports a healthy inflammatory response, joint repair, and function and mobility. It strengthens and firms elastin in the dermis layer of skin, providing an anti aging effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style=""font-weight: 400; font-size: 10pt; font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;"">Collagen Peptides Powder is rich in the amino acids glycine, proline, hydroxyproline and alanine which helps promote collagen synthesis in our body. Made with 10g of Grass-Fed, Non-GMO bovine collagen peptides and 2g of MCT in a creamer that mixes instantly, flavors your coffee and contains no gluten, dairy, soy, wheat, preservatives, or artificial colors or flavors.
