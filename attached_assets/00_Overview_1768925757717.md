# Homer Memory, Files & User Awareness - Overview

## Goal
Transform Homer into a personalized AI assistant that:
- Remembers important facts and context across conversations
- Can receive and share files (images, documents, reports)
- Knows each team member personally and adapts communication style

## Team Members (4 Users)
| Name | Role | Access Level |
|------|------|--------------|
| Ryan Sorensen | Admin | Full access, technical preferences |
| Jacalyn Phillips | Owner-Manager | Strategic focus, high-level insights |
| Leanne Anthon | Owner-Manager | Operations focus |
| Lynley Gray | Owner-Manager | Operations focus |

## Example Interactions After Implementation

**Personalized Greeting:**
> "Good morning, Jacalyn! Based on yesterday's numbers, I thought you'd want to know that Lake Geneva exceeded projections by 12%."

**Memory in Action:**
> Ryan: "Remember that we're switching POS systems next month"
> Homer: "Got it, Ryan. I've noted that you're planning a POS migration for February. I'll factor that into any inventory or sales analysis."

**File Sharing:**
> Leanne: "Here's the vendor quote for the new espresso machine" [uploads PDF]
> Homer: "Thanks, Leanne. I've saved the quote from Alpine Equipment - $4,200 for the La Marzocco. Want me to compare this against our equipment budget?"

## Storage
- Files stored in existing storage system (local or S3)
- Memories stored in PostgreSQL with vector-ready structure
- User profiles cached for fast context building
