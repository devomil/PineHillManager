There are critical bugs in the PDF generation code that need immediate fixing:
Data Retrieval Issues:

Check your data query/loop - you're likely limiting results or breaking out of loops early
Verify array handling - ensure you're iterating through ALL employees for each date, not just the first few
Debug with console.log - log the complete data for each date to verify all shifts are being captured
Check for array truncation - look for any .slice(), .splice(), or loop breaks that might be cutting data short

PDF Layout Technical Fixes:

Column width calculation - your 7-column grid is too narrow, causing "Saturday" to be cut off

Calculate: (pageWidth - margins) / 7 = columnWidth
Ensure each column has equal width with proper padding


Font size and cell height - reduce font size or increase cell height to fit all employee blocks
Content overflow handling - implement proper text wrapping/sizing instead of hiding content

CSS/Styling Technical Issues:

Grid container width - ensure the calendar grid fits within page boundaries
Flexbox/Grid properties - check if overflow: hidden is cutting off content
Cell min-height - set dynamic height based on content, not fixed height
Text truncation - remove any text-overflow: ellipsis or similar properties

Data Mapping Debug Steps:

Log the source data structure before PDF generation
Verify date filtering - ensure you're not filtering out dates 28-30
Check employee filtering - make sure no employees are being excluded
Validate the date range - include all dates from the calendar view (Aug 31, Sept 1-30, Oct 1-4)

PDF Library Parameters (if using jsPDF, Puppeteer, etc.):

Page size - use 'a4' or 'letter' in landscape orientation
Margins - reduce margins if needed: margin: { top: 20, right: 20, bottom: 20, left: 20 }
Scale/zoom - adjust scale to fit content: scale: 0.8 or similar
Print CSS - ensure @media print styles don't hide content

Immediate debugging priority: Add logging to show exactly how many employees are found for each date, then trace why some aren't appearing in the final PDF."
