Screenshot 2: Scene 1 (Hook) Details

Video Provider: Kling 2.6 Master ✅ (correct provider)
Workflow: Standard Workflow, 90% match
"No brand assets detected" - Correct for this scene
But: Video player is empty/black - did generation fail?


The Core Issues
Issue 1: Only B-Roll Gets Video
The system treats scene types differently:

B-Roll → Routes to video generation ✅
Everything else → Routes to image + Ken Burns ❌

This is wrong! When Premium tier is selected, ALL scenes should use video.
Issue 2: Pine Hill Farm Interior NOT Being Used
The visual direction mentions:

"Warm, sunlit living room with natural wood furniture..."

You uploaded "Pine Hill Farm Interior" photo. Why isn't it:

Matched to this scene (it's an interior workspace/living area)
Used via I2V to create the video

Issue 3: Images Instead of Video (95% of scenes)
From PiAPI logs earlier:

Txt2Img: $0.0015 × many calls
Video_generation: Only a few at $0.26

Premium tier should force video for ALL scenes (Phase 15G), but it's not happening.

What Should Happen
For Scene 1 (Hook):
Visual Direction: "Warm, sunlit living room with natural wood furniture..."

1. Asset Matching:
   - "living room", "interior" → Should match location-interior-workspace
   - Should find "Pine Hill Farm Interior" photo
   
2. If Asset Matched:
   - Use I2V with Pine Hill Farm Interior as source
   - Generate video that animates the REAL interior photo
   
3. If No Asset Matched (current):
   - Premium tier → Must use T2V (text-to-video)
   - NOT image + Ken Burns
For ALL Scenes (Premium Tier):
Every scene must use either:
- I2V (if brand asset matched) → Animate real photo
- T2V (if no brand asset) → Generate actual AI video

NEVER use:
- Image + Ken Burns (that's for Standard tier only)

The Missing Enforcement
Phase 15G documented this, but clearly it's not implemented:
typescript// THIS CHECK IS NOT HAPPENING:

if (qualityTier === 'premium' || qualityTier === 'ultra') {
  // FORCE video generation
  if (hasBrandAsset) {
    return generateI2V(brandAsset);  // Animate brand photo
  } else {
    return generateT2V(visualDirection);  // AI video from text
  }
  
  // NEVER fall through to image generation
}
